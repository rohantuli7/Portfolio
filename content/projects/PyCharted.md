This project designs and implements an object-oriented adventure game scenario in python by taking inspiration from the PlayStation game, Uncharted. The overall objective of the game is to locate blue sap of a tree, which when ingested makes the drinker nearly invincible. In order to simulate the working of Uncharted, few missions from the game are taken and respective classes based on those missions are created. Each of the classes depict a level to be completed by the user.
