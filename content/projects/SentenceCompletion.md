Microsoft Sentence Completion Challenge is a benchmark proposed by researchers at Microsoft. This challenge provides a common measurement technique for testing the performance of different models developed using distinct methodologies. In this research, three approaches have been implemented which are based on traditional n-gram models, word embeddings similarity and deep learning models. The models have also been tested for statistical metrics such as accuracy, entropy, and uncertainty.
